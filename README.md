# Calculator Plan
In HTML we need (a list of what DOM we need to GET BY ID):
Two inputs
Let the user INPUT two numbers
A button
Let the user DECIDE WHEN to add them
Results section
Let the user SEE the result
Validation: Log out all these "operative" elements in JS

Add event listener to the button
Validation: log out ANYTHING in the "action area". This should log out on click

What happens in the event listener?
Apply the sum operation to the inputs
Get the values (as strings) of the inputs
log out the values
Turn these strings into numbers
log out the NUMBER values
Add them together
log out the sum
"Output the result" - show the answer to the user
Define a const for the sum
change the textContent property of the results section
(clear out the inputs)
